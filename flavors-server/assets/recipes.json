      "Heat the olive oil in a large pan, then tip in the onion and garlic. Cook over a moderate heat until the onion has softened, about 5 mins. Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e, then pour in the chopped tomatoes and basil leaves, and bring up to the boil. Turn the heat down and leave to simmer for about 15 mins until thick and full of flavour. If you like a smooth soup, whizz the mixture at this point to form a smooth sauce. Can now be cooled and frozen for up to 1 month.",
      "To finish the soup, tip the tomato mixture into a pan. Spoon the baking soda into a small bowl and pour over 1 tbsp or so of the milk. Mix together until there are no lumps, then tip into the tomato mix and pour over the milk. Bring up to a boil (the mixture will froth, but don\u2019t worry \u2013 it will go away). Gently simmer for about 5 mins until ready to serve."

    "instructions": [
      "Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.",
      "Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.",
      "Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).",
      "Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.",
      "Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.",
      "Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.",
      "Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.",
      "Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.",
      "Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in \u00bd tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and stir the sauce well.",
      "Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.",
      "Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn\u2019t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn\u2019t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.",
      "Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.",
      "Taste a bit of the chilli and season. It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think.",
      "Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle.",
      "Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice."

    "instructions": [
      "Put the chillies in a bowl and add enough boiling water to just cover. Leave to soften for 20 mins. If you can\u2019t find anchos, grill red peppers until they\u2019re really blackened and soft. Cool them, then peel and use as needed in the recipe, adding 1 tsp smoked paprika and a little extra chipotle to re-create the sweet, smoky flavour.",
      "Meanwhile, heat the oil in a flameproof casserole dish, season the chicken, then brown on all sides. You may have to do this in batches so you don\u2019t overcrowd the dish. Remove to a plate. Add the onions to the dish and cook for 5 mins until softened. Add the spices and cook for 1 min until aromatic.",
      "Remove the chillies from their soaking liquid, reserving the liquid, and discard the stalks and seeds. Put in a food processor with 4 tbsp of the soaking liquid, the garlic and raisins. Whizz to a paste, then tip into the dish. Add the peanut butter, chipotle paste, tomatoes and 400ml water (fill up the tomato can and swirl to get all the tomato bits out). Return the chicken to the dish and season. Cover with a lid and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 1 hr.",
      "Remove the chicken pieces to a plate. Using 2 forks, shred the meat and discard the bones. Return the chicken to the sauce, add the chocolate and continue cooking, uncovered, for 30 mins more. If the sauce looks like it\u2019s getting a little too thick, add some of the chilli soaking liquid or some water.",
      "Cook the rice following pack instructions. Meanwhile, put the red onion in a small bowl. Add the lime juice and a pinch of salt. Leave to pickle until ready to serve. When the rice is cooked, add the coriander and lime zest and juice, and fluff up with a fork. Remove the mole from the heat, scatter with the pickled red onion and serve alongside the rice, with soured cream and lime wedges, if you like."

      "Bring a large pan of lightly salted water to the boil, then add the cavolo nero. Cook for 1-2 mins until the kale turns bright green and softens. Lift out with tongs into a colander, keeping the cooking water to boil the pasta. Run cold water over the kale, squeeze out any excess water, then transfer to a food processor. Add the oil, garlic, lemon juice and 1 tsp salt, then blitz to a fine pesto. Season to taste and transfer to a small pan. Gently warm over a medium-low heat.",

      "Bring the pan of cavolo water to the boil again, adding more water if needed. Add the pasta sheets and simmer following pack instructions. Drain, keeping back a cup of the pasta water to add to the sauce (about 400ml). Cut the pasta sheets in half and toss in a little olive oil.",
      "Stir the reserved pasta water through the cavolo sauce and keep on a low heat. If the sauce looks thick, thin down with a little more water, or increase the heat a little if too thin; it should be pourable like double cream. Spoon a pool of sauce onto each plate. Layer the lasagne sheets on top with spoonfuls of the goat\u2019s cheese paste in-between each layer. Top with the last sheet of pasta and ladle over a little more sauce, then scatter over the cheese. Recipe adapted from Home Cook by Thomasina Miers (\u00a325, Guardian Books)"

    "instructions": [
      "Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.",
      "Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.",
      "Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.",
      "Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).",
      "Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.",
      "While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.",
      "Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.",
      "Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don\u2019t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don\u2019t throw the pasta water away yet.",
      "Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.",
      "Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn\u2019t scramble, and everything is coated.",
      "Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don\u2019t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.",
      "Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived."

Simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened and has a coating consistency (run your finger through the sauce on a spoon \u2013 it should leave a trail). Remove the pan from the heat, then add the cheddar and mustard powder. Season, then stir until the cheese has melted.",

When the mince is well toasted, sprinkle over the taco seasoning and cook for 2 mins, then stir through the tomato pur\u00e9e and pour over the rest of the lime juice and let it sizzle for another minute.

Brush the filo with a thin layer of oil, then fold in half lengthways with the short edge towards you. Keep the remaining pastry covered with a damp cloth so it doesn\u2019t dry out. Spoon a sixth of the cooled filling at one end of the strip, and leave a 2cm border. Take the right corner and fold diagonally to the left, enclosing the filling and forming a triangle. Fold again along the upper crease of the triangle. Keep folding in this way until you reach the end of the strip. Place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Repeat the process until all of the mix is used up.",

    "instructions": [
      "Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.",
      "Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.",
      "Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).",
      "Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.",
      "Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.",
      "Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.",
      "Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.",
      "Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.",
      "Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in \u00bd tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and stir the sauce well.",
      "Simmer it gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.",
      "Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn\u2019t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn\u2019t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.",
      "Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.",
      "Taste a bit of the chilli and season. It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think.",
      "Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle.",

Rub on the inside of each lamb breast. Next, stack the breasts on top of each other and roll up the longest side into a sausage shape. Use the butchers string to tie knots along the length of the lamb.",

Put the lid on, then cook in the oven for 4 hrs until tender. Remove the dish and leave to cool. Once the fat is cool enough, remove the lamb using two slotted spoons. Reserve the cooled fat as you will need 1 tbsp tomorrow, and save the rest to make roasties. Lay the lamb roll on some cling film, then roll as tight as you can. Chill on a baking tray in the fridge overnight.",

Bring the pan of chips to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 8-10 mins until the potatoes start to soften \u2013 you should be able to easily break a chip in half. Drain and leave to steam-dry in the colander for 5 mins. Drizzle a large baking tray with the veg oil and put in the oven for a few minutes to heat up.",

      "Flour a work surface and roll out each piece of dough into a roughly 25cm round. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and cook each for 2-3 mins on each side until puffed up and golden in spots. Wrap in foil and keep warm in a low oven.",

      "Once the dough has doubled, tip it out onto the work surface and flatten it to remove any air pockets. Sprinkle over the halloumi in an even layer, then the chipotle flakes.

      "Put the loaf on its tray into the roasting tin, then pour some hot water into the tin around the tray to create steam while baking. This will give you a crisp crust. Bake for 20-25 mins until the loaf is golden and sounds hollow when you tap the base.",

      "To make the flatbreads, tip the flour into a bowl and add 150g yogurt, or up to 200g if the dough looks too dry, then mix using a cutlery knife until it comes together into a ball. Tip the dough onto a work surface and knead for 2 mins until smooth. Split into four balls, then dust the work surface with flour and roll each into a large flatbread (or make eight mini ones). Dry-fry the flatbreads in a frying pan on medium heat for a couple of minutes on each side.",

      "First, make the pastry. Tip the flour and butter into a bowl, then rub together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Mix in the egg, then bring everything together using your hands until just combined. Form into a disc. Will keep wrapped and chilled for up to two days or frozen for up to a month.",
      "Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface into a disc that\u2019s roughly 28cm in diameter. Use the rolling pin to lift it over a 23cm tart tin, then drape it over the tin. Use a small ball of pastry scraps to push the pastry into the base and up the side of the tin, leaving the excess to overhang. Chill in the fridge for 20 mins. The tin can be lined and chilled up to a day ahead.",
      "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan over a low-medium heat and cook the onions for 45 mins, seasoning them generously with salt and stirring occasionally until they become sticky and golden. Pour in the cream, then add the nutmeg and stir. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lightly prick the base of the tart all over with a fork, then line with a large circle of baking parchment and fill with baking beans, dried rice or pulses. Bake for 20 mins, then remove the beans and parchment, and bake for 10-15 mins more until light brown. Break off a little of the the overhanging pastry to check that it\u2019s done \u2013 it should be cooked through and crumbly.",
      "Meanwhile, stir the egg yolks into the onion and cream mixture, and stir in two-thirds of the cheese. Tip into the pastry case, then sprinkle over the rest of the cheese and bake for 20-25 mins, or until just set and golden. Leave to cool completely in the tin, trim the overhang using a serrated knife, then remove from the tin. Sprinkle with chives and more cheese, if you like. Any leftovers will keep chilled for up to two days. Reheat in a low oven before serving."

    "description": "Slow-cooked tender ham, potatoes and shallots are enclosed in cheesy cheddar pastry - invest in a pie plate or tin for a crisp base",
    "instructions": [
      "For the pastry, wrap the butter in foil and place in the freezer the night before you need it. Put the ham hocks, bay leaves and peppercorns in a large pan. Cover with water and a lid, and simmer for 3 hrs or until really tender \u2013 you may need to top up the water level during cooking. (Alternatively, cook in a slow cooker for 6-8 hrs.) Leave to cool in the liquid, then chill overnight if you have time.",
      "To make the pastry, tip the flour into a big bowl with 1/2 tsp salt and the mustard powder. Hold the butter block in the foil (peeling back a little at a time as you need to) and coarsely grate straight into the bowl of flour, dipping the end of the butter into the flour every so often \u2013 this helps to stop all the butter clumping together. Grate in the cheese too. Use a cutlery knife to lightly stir together, then stir in 175-200ml cold water to bring the dough together. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling water for 8 mins or until just cooked, then drain. Melt the butter in another large pan and add the shallots. Cook gently for 10-15 mins until tender and golden, shaking the pan now and then to roll them around in the butter. While they cook, drain the ham hocks, reserving the cooking liquid \u2013 the meat should be nice and tender. Shred with two forks, discarding the fat and bones.",
      "When the shallots are tender, scoop them out of the pan and add to the ham. Add the flour and mustard powder to the butter, stirring around the pan to make a paste. Cook for 1-2 mins, then splash in a little of the milk, stirring until smooth. Continue adding the milk, bit by bit, stirring well after each addition, until you have a very thick, smooth sauce. Add enough of the ham\u2019s cooking liquid to thin the sauce to a double cream consistency, about 300ml. Taste and season with pepper \u2013 it should be salty enough from the ham stock, but add a little extra if it needs it. Stir in the ham, potatoes, shallots, wholegrain mustard, honey and parsley, then leave to cool.",
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf to heat up. Remove the pastry from the fridge. Divide into 2 balls, one a little larger than the other \u2013 keep the smaller one wrapped until later. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the large ball of dough to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Use this to line the base of a 23cm metal pie plate or shallow cake tin. Fill with the pie filling, then brush the edges with a little beaten egg. Roll out the remaining pastry, lay over the top, then trim the excess. Crimp the sides of the pie, if you like. Brush with more egg wash and poke 2 steam holes in the top with a sharp knife. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 45-50 mins until crisp and golden. Serve piping hot with green veg and gravy, if you like."

      "First make the pastry. Tip the flours into a food processor with \u00bd tsp salt and the diced butter. Pulse until you can\u2019t feel any lumps, then tip in the walnuts. Mix the egg yolks with 3 tbsp cold water, then dribble this into the machine while you pulse again until the pastry comes together. Tip the pastry out onto a floured surface, lightly bring it together into a ball, then roll out and line a deep 20-23cm tart tin with overhang. The pastry may crack, but just patch it back together, then cover and chill for 1 hr.",
      "To make the filling, melt the remaining butter in a large pan, then add the shallots and soften for 10-15 mins, until golden and squishy. Stir in the thyme for 1 min, then remove from the heat. Beat the eggs in a jug with the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and cream. Crumble in the cheese and season with pepper and a small amount of salt.",
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Blind bake the pastry for 20 mins, remove the baking beans and paper, then bake for a further 15-20 mins until golden and sandy. Reduce the oven temp to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Add the cooled onions to the cream mixture and pour into the case. Sit the fig halves on top, cut side up, sprinkle with some more thyme and bake on the middle shelf for 1 hr-1hr 10 mins until the tart is browning and has a slight wobble \u2013 the cheese middle will firm up on sitting. Cool for about 15-20 mins, then remove from tin and serve with a green salad."

    "instructions": [
      "First, make the pastry. Put the flour, mustard powder, \u00bd tsp salt, the lard and butter in a food processor and pulse until combined. Add 1 egg and pulse again. Add 1 tbsp cold water, if needed, until it forms a short pastry. Knead quickly into a ball, then wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 mins. Can be made three days ahead or frozen for two months.",
      "Season the steak generously and toss with the flour and mustard powder. Heat half the oil in a large pan. Brown the meat in a few batches, adding more oil as you need to and making sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan. Turn the meat only when the underside has a nice dark crust. Transfer the chunks to a plate as you go.",
      "Add the bacon to the pan and fry until beginning to crisp. Tip in the carrots, onions and bay leaves and cook for another few mins until the veg is soft. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and tomato pur\u00e9e for 1 min, scraping the tasty bits from the bottom of the pan, then add the stock, thyme and browned beef. Season, cover the pan and simmer gently for 2\u00bd hrs, stirring now and again to prevent the sauce from sticking, until the beef is tender. Remove the lid for the last 30 mins to thicken the sauce. Alternatively, braise in the oven at 160C/140C fan/gas 3 for the same amount of time. Leave to cool. Can be chilled for up to three days, or frozen for two months.",
      "Transfer the beef to a pie dish and crumble the cheese over the top. Place the marrowbone in the centre, nestling it into the meat. Alternatively, use a pie funnel or piping nozzle. Roll out the pastry on a floured worktop until large enough to cover the pie and about \u00bdcm thick. Brush the remaining beaten egg over the edges of the pie dish, drape the pastry over, trim the excess and pinch around the edge to seal. Cut a hole for the marrowbone or pie funnel to poke through, and brush the top all over with beaten egg. Use the pastry trimmings to decorate the pie however you like. Chill for about 30 mins while you heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "If you have any beaten egg left, give the pie a final brush for extra glossiness. Bake for 45-50 mins until the pastry is deep golden."

Place 4 of the pieces of squash down the longest length in the middle to make a rectangular block, keeping a generous border of pastry all the way round. Place another 2 pieces of squash on top. Trim the remaining 2 pieces and put crossways at the end. Scatter over the sage and blue cheese, then top with the shallots and pecans. Lightly press to compact everything together.",

Tuck under the pastry at both ends, then brush all over with egg. Cut leaf shapes from the pastry trimmings and use to decorate the top of the Wellington. Glaze again and make a couple of small air holes with the point of a knife.",
      "To freeze: Open-freeze on a baking tray until solid, then wrap in cling film then foil. It will keep for 2 months. To serve, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put a baking tray in to heat up. Unwrap the Wellington and place on the hot tray. Bake for 30 mins. Cover lightly with foil and bake for 35-40 mins more, taking off the foil for the final 10 mins. Leave to settle for 10 mins before thickly slicing, or the cheese will be too melty and run out.

To make the gravy, add the shallot and garlic to the pan juices and cook, stirring, until softened and golden. Pour in the wine, add the herbs and leave to bubble for 2 mins. Pour in the stock and stir in the flour paste, stirring all the time until the gravy has thickened. Cover and cook for 5 mins over a low heat, then strain into a bowl or small freezer container, pushing through as much liquid left in the shallots as you can.",
      "Wash the pan, then melt the butter and cook the shallot and garlic until softened. Add the mushrooms and thyme, and fry for 10 mins, stirring frequently, to drive off as much moisture as possible. Season with black pepper and sparingly with salt. Cool.",
      "Lay a couple of sheets of cling film on the work surface, side by side and slightly overlapping, then arrange the prosciutto down the centre in two overlapping rows. Spread the mushroom mixture on top, then scatter evenly with the cheese and walnuts. Place the steak on top, then tightly wrap the prosciutto round it, using the cling film to help you. Finally, tightly wrap in the cling film and chill for 30 mins.",
      "Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until you think it is large enough to completely wrap round the steak roll. Unwrap the meat, place on top of the pastry and brush round it with the egg mixture. Tightly roll up in the pastry, trimming the excess as you bring the pastry together down the length and ends, sealing well. If you want to add decoration, cut out leaf shapes from the trimmings and use the egg mixture to stick them to the pastry. Chill until ready to cook. Will keep for 2 days. (If freezing, wrap in new cling film, then foil, and freeze along with the gravy and egg glaze. The day before, take everything out of the freezer and put in the fridge, unwrapping the steak roll and covering it loosely with kitchen paper.)",
      "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 with a baking sheet inside. Place the (completely thawed) meat on a piece of baking parchment and brush with the egg glaze. Place on the hot baking sheet and cook for 45-50 mins. Insert a meat thermometer into the centre of the beef: for rare it should be 50C, for medium-rare 55C, and for medium 60C. Cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 15-20 mins. Trim off the pastry end, then thickly slice and serve with the gravy, heated in a pan, and seasonal vegetables."

Spoon the filling down the centre of the length of the pastry, leaving the ends clear. Tuck the ends over the filling, then firmly lift up the sides to wrap them round, trimming away any excess pastry as you go. Brush with more egg to glaze, then make a few holes in the top so steam can escape as it cooks. Bake for 40 mins until golden and the filling is firm. Remove from the oven, brush with more glaze and bake for 10 mins more.",

      "Line a 20cm square baking tin with baking parchment. Melt the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water, or do this in 20-second bursts in the microwave. Cut five or six triangles from the biscuits with a sharp knife to make trees. Put the off-cuts in a bowl. Bash into rubble.",
      "Tip the almonds and most of the cherries and marshmallows into the bowl with the bashed biscuits, pour over the chocolate mixture and fold in until coated. Tip into the tin and smooth the top. Press a row or two of the biscuit trees into one end of the rocky road. Sprinkle the rest with the reserved toppings and scatter over the coconut to resemble snow. Transfer the tin to the fridge and chill for 2 hrs until solid. Cut into squares to serve."

      "About 30 mins before you want to bake the madeleines, grease a 12-hole madeleine tin with a little extra butter and dust with a little flour. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and put the tin in the freezer to chill for 30 mins. Remove the batter from the fridge and add about 1 heaped tbsp to each madeleine hole \u2013 be careful not to overfill as they will bake over the edge and won\u2019t form the characteristic hump. Depending on the size of your tin, you will have some batter left \u2013 either bake in batches or put the rest back in the fridge and bake within three days.",
      "Bake in the oven for 10-12 mins or until golden brown around the edges. Immediately turn out the madeleines onto a wire rack and leave to cool fully. Put the chocolate in a microwaveable bowl and heat in the microwave on High in 30 sec bursts until about three-quarters of the chocolate has melted. Remove from the microwave and stir vigorously until the remaining chocolate has melted (this is a simple method of tempering and just ensures the chocolate will set properly at room temperature). Dip each madeleine halfway into the melted chocolate, allowing the excess to drip off, then place on a sheet of baking parchment. As the chocolate starts to set, but while still a little tacky, sprinkle with some of the Blood orange dust (below), if using, and allow to cool."

Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to roughly the thickness of a \u00a31 coin, and use to line a 23cm fluted tart tin, leaving some overhanging. Line with a disc of baking parchment big enough to cover the edges, and fill with some baking beans to weigh it down (use dried rice or lentils if you don\u2019t have baking beans). Bake for 15 mins, then remove the parchment and beans and bake for 10-15 mins more until the pastry is biscuity. Trim away any overhanging pastry with a serrated knife. Set aside to cool.",

Cover and cook over a low heat for 25-30 mins, stirring occasionally and adding more water if needed, until the apples have collapsed into a pur\u00e9e. Taste the mixture and sweeten with more sugar, if needed.",

Spread the apple pur\u00e9e over the base of the tart case, then arrange the apple slices in neat, concentric circles, starting from the outside. Brush the apples with butter, then scatter over the reserved sugar and bake for another 20-25 mins until golden.",
      "Mix the jam with 1 tbsp hot water from a freshly boiled kettle. When the tart has finished baking, glaze generously with the jam, then leave to cool a little. Serve warm or cold, dusted with icing sugar, if you like."

Spoon the mix into the prepared tin, smooth the top and scatter with the rest of the apples, pressing down lightly into the batter.",

      "Once the cake is out of the oven, prick it all over with a skewer and drizzle over a little more Pomona. Cool for 10 mins, then turn out of the tin and transfer to a wire rack. Brush the glaze over the apples and serve sliced, with dollops of Pomona cream. Best eaten on the day it\u2019s made, or warmed through the next."

      "Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of just-simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn\u2019t touch the water, or do this in the microwave in 20-second bursts until smooth and glossy. Leave to cool slightly. Pour the cream, condensed milk and vanilla into a second bowl and beat for 3 mins using an electric whisk until slightly thickened and the beaters leave a trail in the mixture when lifted across the bowl. Be careful not to overwhip, as you don\u2019t want the mixture to be too stiff \u2013 as soon as the beaters leave a trail, it\u2019s ready.",
      "Gently fold the melted chocolate and cocoa powder into the cream mixture until thoroughly combined, ensuring the spatula is reaching the bottom of the bowl so all the chocolate gets mixed in. Fold in most of the chocolate chips, reserving a small handful. Scrape the mixture into a 1-litre freezerproof container, then scatter over the reserved chocolate chips. Cover and freeze for at least 6 hrs until firm but scoopable. Will keep frozen for up to a month. To serve, scoop the ice cream into chilled bowls or ice cream cones and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt, if you like."

      "To make the pastry, put the flour, butter and icing sugar in a food processor and pulse until it resembles breadcrumbs. With the motor running, slowly add the egg yolks. If the mixture looks too dry, drizzle in 1-2 tbsp cold water. Tip it out onto your work surface and gently knead together. Flatten the pastry into a disc, wrap in cling film and chill for 20 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, make the filling. Pour the milk into a saucepan. Scrape the vanilla seeds from the split pod into the milk and add the pod as well. Heat the milk over a medium heat until it just starts to bubble around the edges. Remove from the heat and leave to cool a little.",
      "Beat the egg yolks, sugar and flour together with an electric whisk for 5-10 mins until pale and mousse-like. Remove the vanilla pod from the cooled milk and steadily pour over the beaten egg yolks, whisking constantly.",
      "Pour the custard mixture into a clean saucepan. Heat over a medium-low heat, whisking all of the time. Cook the custard for 10 mins, still whisking, until it is very thick. Remove from the heat and push through a sieve into a wide dish. Cover the surface with cling film to prevent the custard from forming a skin. Set aside to cool while you prepare the pastry case.",
      "Roll out the pastry between 2 pieces of baking parchment to line a 24cm loose bottomed, fluted tart tin. Cover with cling film and chill for 30 mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line the tart case with foil or baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15 mins. Carefully remove the baking beans and foil, then return to the oven for 5-10 mins until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin on a wire rack while you finish the filling.",
      "Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Gently beat the custard with the ricotta, orange zest and grated chocolate until just combined, and spread evenly in the tart shell. Sprinkle over the pine nuts and bake for 35-40 mins \u2013 the filling will still be quite wobbly but it will firm up as it cools. Chill for at least 3 hrs, or overnight. Dust with icing sugar to serve."

Whisk 2 of the eggs and 200ml buttermilk together. Scrape the melted chocolate mixture and egg mixture into the dry ingredients. Add 150ml boiling water and whizz everything together with an electric whisk until lump-free. Divide between the tins and bake for 40-45 mins, swapping round after 30 mins if they\u2019re on different shelves (the 15cm one should be done after 40 mins). To test they\u2019re cooked, push in a skewer and check it comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their tins.",

      "Melt the white chocolate in a bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Beat together the butter and icing sugar, then beat in the white chocolate. When the cakes are cool, split each one in half. Use the icing to sandwich back together so you end up with 2 x four-layered cakes. Sit the 20cm cake on your serving plate and spread some more icing over the top. Sit the smaller cake on top of that, and completely cover with icing. Decorate with the chocolate buttons.",
      "If you want to add some flowers choose something edible, like roses. Make a posy, wrapping the stems in a little damp kitchen paper then some cling film, add a ribbon and add to the cake on the day of the wedding."

    "instructions": [
      "Simmer the potatoes for about 20 mins until tender, then drain and mash with most of the butter, plenty of seasoning and a little milk. Season and set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, cut the fish into 2cm cubes. Bring the milk just to a simmer in a large frying pan \u2013 when you see a few small bubbles, add the fish, onion and bay leaves, then cover and cook for 6-8 mins. Lift the fish out onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug.",
      "Melt the butter in a pan, stir in the flour and cook for 1 min over a medium heat. Take off the heat, pour in a little poaching milk, then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bring to the boil, then simmer for 5 mins, stirring continuously, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then mix in the parsley.",
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Divide the fish between 2 ovenproof dishes, about 1.3 litres each and strain any juices into the sauce. Scatter over the prawns, then add the eggs to both dishes if eating straightaway, or to just one dish if freezing the other. Pour the sauce over both. Spoon half of the mash over one dish so it covers everything, making sure it reaches the sides. Rough up the top with a fork and dot with remaining butter. Bake for 30 mins until the top is golden. Freeze the remaining fish and mash (see tips, below)."

      "Heat 25g of the butter in a shallow pan and sizzle the shallot for 2 mins. Add the prawn heads, shells and smoked haddock skin and trimmings, turn up the heat and cook for 5 mins until they start to brown. Throw in the bay and star anise, then splash in the pernod if using and then the wine. Boil everything down until practically evaporated, then pour over 1 litre of milk and sprinkle in the vegetable bouillon. Simmer everything for 15 mins, turn off the heat, crush the shells with a potato masher and strain into a jug.",

Gradually stir in the flavoured milk, then the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and simmer gently to make a very thick sauce. Season to taste. Turn off the heat and gently fold through all the fish and prawns, capers and lemon juice. Scrape into a large buttered baking dish.",

Scoop out the eggs, put in a bowl of cold water to cool, then peel, halve and push into the sauce. Drain the potatoes and mash with the remaining milk and butter. Spread or pipe the mash over the pie. Sprinkle with gruy\u00e8re and/or crush over crisps. Put the pie on a baking tray and cook for 35 mins until golden and just bubbling over. Leave to sit for at least 10 mins before eating with buttered spinach, peas or watercress."

Pour over another third of the sauce, then top with more fish. Continue the layers once more, finishing with sauce.",

Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bring to the boil and cook for 5 mins, stirring continually, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, then pour over the fish.",
      "Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil 1kg floury potatoes, cut into even-sized chunks, for 20 mins. Drain, season and mash with the remaining 50g butter and 100ml full-fat milk. Use to top the pie, starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in \u2013 push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork, sprinkle over 50g grated cheddar, then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead, chill, then bake for 40 mins."

      "Heat the stock in a small pan and add the salmon and pollock. Simmer gently for 5 mins, then turn off the heat and leave to sit for 5 mins more.

Spread onto the base of 1 large or 2 smaller overnproof dishes with the prawns, peas, dill and green beans.",

Season, crush lightly with a fork or potato masher, then spoon over the fish. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese and chives.",

      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Divide the fish between 2 ovenproof dishes, about 1.3 litres each and strain any juices into the sauce. Scatter over the prawns, then add the eggs to both dishes if eating straightaway, or to just one dish if freezing the other. Pour the sauce over both. Spoon half of the mash over one dish so it covers everything, making sure it reaches the sides. Rough up the top with a fork and dot with remaining butter. Bake for 30 mins until the top is golden. Freeze the remaining fish and mash (see tips, below)."

Stir to release the mussel juices, then pour the contents of the pan into a colander set over a large bowl containing the saffron. Let the saffron steep in the stock \u2013 you will need 700ml in total, so top up with water if needed and give everything a good stir. Pick the mussels out from the colander, then set aside.",
      "Wipe out the pan and add the rest of the olive oil. Sizzle the chorizo until it releases its oil, then add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. Add the squid and turn over until it turns white. Add the tomatoes and cook down for a minute, then pour over most of the stock, give everything a good stir and bring to the boil. Scatter the rice over the stock, stir well once, then boil vigorously for 5 mins. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and slowly simmer for 10 mins without stirring until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid.",
      "Tuck the prawn tails into the rice and simmer for 5 mins, turning them over until cooked through. Stir through the mussels and broad beans or peas. Taste the rice \u2013 if it is still a little raw but the pan is dry, add a splash more stock and continue to cook; if it\u2019s too soupy, then increase the heat to cook off the last of the stock.",
      "Once the rice is just cooked, turn off the heat and cover with a tea towel for a few minutes. Scatter over the parsley leaves and lemon zest, then season with smoked salt if you like. Stir everything once, then serve straight from the pan, with lemon wedges on the side."

When almost cooked, remove from the oven and spread onto a tray to cool. Chill and reserve for later. You can make this a day ahead.",

Season the cod with sea salt and black pepper, then cook, skin-side down, in the hot pan, for 4 mins, then carefully turn the fish over and put the pan in the oven for a further 3 mins, finishing with a little more sea salt and a squeeze of lemon juice.",

    "instructions": [
      "Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. To make the saffron and garlic paste, cut the whole heads of garlic in half horizontally. Place the garlic heads, cut-side up, on a small baking tray. Drizzle over a little olive oil and season with salt. Cover with foil and bake for 40-50 mins until softened. Remove the foil and return to the oven for a further 15-20 mins until the garlic has turned golden brown.",
      "Meanwhile, make the soup base. Chop the fennel, celery and onion into small dice and thinly slice the red chilli. Heat the oil in a large saucepan and add the chopped vegetables. Grate the garlic into the pan and add the fennel seeds. Stir well, then cover and sweat for 10 mins. Add the saffron and bay leaves, and cook for a further 10 mins until the vegetables start to soften. Pour in the Pernod and wine, bring to the boil, then add the passata and 400ml water. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to a simmer. Cover and cook for 45 mins until all of the flavours have started to work together, then remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool a little.",
      "Transfer the soup to a jug blender and blend until smooth, then pass through a fine sieve into a clean saucepan \u2013 you may need to do this in batches. If the soup needs thickening, reduce over a medium heat. When it is the consistency of pouring cream, remove from the heat and set aside, or leave to cool and chill in the fridge until needed. The base of the soup can be made 3 days ahead.",
      "Meanwhile, for the paste, pour the Pernod into a small saucepan and add the saffron. Bring to the boil, add the olive oil and warm gently. Take off the heat and leave to cool.",
      "When the garlic is golden brown, remove the tray from the oven and squeeze the cloves out into the bowl of a pestle and mortar. Add a large pinch of flaky sea salt and pound to a paste. Slowly add the saffron-infused olive oil, stirring constantly. Transfer to a clean container and chill until needed.",
      "Bring the soup base to the boil in a large pan, then turn down to a light simmer and taste for seasoning. Add the chunks of prepared fish and squid, and gently poach the fish in the soup for 10 mins, or until it is just cooked. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and parsley. Ladle the soup into bowls, piling up the fish in the centre. Spoon on the saffron and garlic paste and sprinkle over some more parsley. Serve with toasted slices of baguette and the extra saffron and garlic paste on the side."

    "description": "Make this classic French fish soup at a dinner party for friends and family. It's a challenge, but will make an impressive starter or main course",
    "instructions": [
      "To make the croutons heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lay the slices of bread on a flat baking tray in a single layer, drizzle with olive oil and bake for 15 mins until golden and crisp. Set aside \u2013 can be made a day ahead and kept in an airtight container.",
      "Use a layer of the green part of the leek to wrap around and make a herb bundle with the thyme, bay, parsley stalks, orange peel and chilli. Tie everything together with kitchen string and set aside.",
      "Heat the oil in a very large casserole dish or stock pot and throw in the onion, sliced leek and fennel and cook for about 10 mins until softened. Stir through the garlic and cook for 2 mins more, then add the herb bundle, tomato pur\u00e9e, star anise, Pernod if using, chopped tomatoes and saffron. Simmer and stir for a minute or two then pour over the fish stock. Season with salt and pepper, bring to a simmer, then add the piece of potato. Bubble everything gently for 30 mins until you have a thin tomatoey soup. When that piece of potato is on the brink of collapse, fish it out and set aside to make the rouille.",
      "While the broth is simmering make the rouille by crushing the garlic, chilli and saffron with a pinch of salt in a mortar with a pestle. Mash in the cooked potato to make a sticky paste then whisk in the egg yolk and, very gradually, the olive oil until you make a mayonnaise-like sauce. Stir in the lemon juice and set aside.",
      "Once the chunky tomato broth has cooked you have two options: for a rustic bouillabaisse, simply poach your fish in it along with the mussels, if you're using (just until they open) and serve. For a refined version, remove the herb bundle and star anise. Using a handheld or table-top blender, blitz the soup until smooth. Pass the soup through a sieve into a large, clean pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Starting with the densest fish, add the chunks to the broth and cook for 1 min before adding the next type. With the fish we used, the order was: monkfish, John Dory, grey mullet, snapper. When all the fish is in, scatter over the mussels, if using, and simmer everything for about 5 mins until just cooked and the mussels have opened.",
      "Use a slotted spoon to carefully scoop the fish and mussels out onto a warmed serving platter, moisten with just a little broth and scatter over the chopped parsley. Bring everything to the table. Some people eat it as two courses, serving the broth with croutons and rouille first, then the fish spooned into the same bowl. Others simply serve it as a fish stew. Whichever way you choose the rouille is there to be stirred into the broth to thicken and give it a kick."

Stuff the couscous into the cavity of each fish, reserving any leftover couscous for later.",

    "description": "Make our Greek pasta salad with the kids. The recipe is specially designed for younger cooks, and we've noted all the equipment they'll need to make it",
    "instructions": [
      "Fill a medium saucepan with hot water from the tap until it\u2019s three-quarters full. Set the pan on the hob. Season the water with a pinch of salt, then turn the heat to medium-high \u2013 the water should start to boil after a minute or so. Slowly tip the pasta into the boiling water \u2013 do this carefully, as any splashes could burn your skin.",
      "Holding the handle of the saucepan with one hand (use a cloth if it\u2019s hot), carefully stir the pasta with a long wooden spoon in the other hand \u2013 this will prevent the pasta from sticking together. Set a timer for 10 mins. Stir the pasta every minute or so, and keep checking the heat to make sure the water is gently boiling while the timer counts down.",
      "While the pasta cooks, measure 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 tsp dried oregano into a mixing bowl. Season with some salt and black pepper, and mix well \u2013 this will make a zingy dressing for the pasta.",
      "When the timer beeps, it\u2019s time to check if the pasta is cooked. To do this, scoop one piece of pasta out of the boiling water using the wooden spoon, tip it onto a plate and leave it to cool slightly. Taste the pasta: if it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s cooked through, but if it\u2019s still a little hard in the middle, it needs to cook for a bit longer. Set the timer for another 2 mins, then check again.",
      "Place a large colander or sieve in the sink. When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and, using two hands, carefully carry the saucepan over to the sink and tip the pasta into the colander to drain away the hot water. Leave to cool for a few minutes in the colander, then tip the pasta into the mixing bowl with the dressing. Mix together until the pasta is coated in the dressing.",
      "Put a chopping board on a work surface. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half by pinching each one between your thumb and index finger, and carefully slicing through the middle of the tomato with a small serrated knife. Slice the pitted olives in the same way, then tip all the tomatoes and olives into the pasta.",
      "Put the cucumber on the chopping board and cut it in half lengthways. Lay the two halves on the board cut-side down, so they don\u2019t roll around. Cut each piece in half again, so you have four long, chunky pieces. Cut across the cucumber pieces in the other direction so you end up with small cucumber triangles. Tip these into the bowl with the pasta, tomatoes and olives.",
      "Put the onion on the board and hold it securely. Cut off the pointy end, then cut the onion in half through the root end. Peel away the papery outer layers until you\u2019re left with just the shiny onion underneath. Lay each onion half on the board, cut-side down so it doesn\u2019t roll around. Holding onto the root end, carefully slice the halves into half-moon shapes, as thinly as you can. Stop when you get to the root. Tip the onions into the bowl.",
      "Crumble the feta cheese into small pieces over the bowl, then gently mix everything together until well combined. Eat straightaway, or chill for up to a day before eating."

Tip in the beef mince, turn up the heat and fry, stirring regularly, for another 10 mins until the mince browns.

Stir through the pur\u00e9e, bay leaves and tomatoes, with a canful of water. Simmer for 1\u00bd hrs, covered for the first hour, then remove the lid and bubble until the tomatoes have broken down. Season with salt, pepper, the sugar and balsamic vinegar.",

      "The bolognese should be a little wetter than you\u2019d like as the pasta shells will absorb some of the liquid as it bakes. Remove from the heat, giving it a final stir. Using a teaspoon, fill the pasta shells with some of the mascarpone mixture, pressing the mix in with your index finger. Nestle the shells into the sauce, filled-side up. Bake for 20-30 mins until the top is golden and bubbling, and the pasta is tender. Grate over some parmesan and finish with a few basil leaves."

    "instructions": [
      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Heat 1 tbsp oil with the butter over a medium heat. Add the bay leaf, rosemary and finely sliced leek, season and cook for a few mins until the leek has softened.",
      "Add the flour and cook for 1 min more until the roux smells nutty. Take off the heat, slowly pour in the milk and whisk out any lumps.",
      "Return to the heat and whisk slowly until thick and smooth, about 5 mins. Season well with grated nutmeg, then add 3/4 of the cheddar and parmesan, cooking until they are melted. Set aside.",
      "In another pan, heat 2 tbsp oil over a medium heat and fry the garlic and chilli for a couple of mins until aromatic. Add the rest of the leeks, season and fry until softened, then add the mixed greens and season a little more. Cook, stirring, until the greens have wilted, about 4 mins, then pour in the wine and cook until it evaporates.",
      "Oil a medium roasting tin (about 20cm square) and tip half the greens into the tin. Dot half the walnuts over the top, and nestle in a third of the artichoke hearts. Dot over half the ricotta. Remove the bay leaf from the leek bechamel and pour over a third of it. Top with three lasagne sheets to cover everything in a at layer. Repeat the process, then cover the top layer of lasagne sheets with the remaining bechamel and artichokes and scatter over the remaining cheese. Bake in the oven for 30-40 mins, until golden and bubbling. Rest for 10 mins, then serve with a sharply dressed grated carrot and beetroot salad."

      "To make the chicken sauce, heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and tip in the chicken. Cook for about 5 mins on each side until golden, then lift onto a plate. Tip the onions into the pan and fry for 10 mins until golden. Add the garlic and herbs. Tip the chicken back in, along with the tomatoes and ketchup, then swill a little water around the cans and pour this in, too. Season and bring to a simmer. Cook for 35 mins until the chicken is pull-apart tender and the sauce is thick. Use two forks to shred the chicken into the sauce. Set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Put everything in a saucepan with some seasoning, then bring to a simmer, whisking continuously. Simmer for 5 mins, still whisking until smooth and thick, then remove from the heat. If not assembling the lasagne straightaway, cover and set aside to cool before chilling. Will keep covered and chilled for two days.",
      "Spread a thin layer of the chicken sauce in an ovenproof baking dish (ours was 20 x 30cm), drizzle with some of the white sauce and dot over a third of the pesto using a teaspoon. Scatter with a third of the mozzarella, then add a layer of four or five lasagne sheets (you may need to break one of the sheets to fill the gaps), then repeat the layers twice, finishing with a thick layer of the white sauce. Scatter the parmesan over the top. Will keep chilled for a day or frozen for three months. Leave to cool first. Defrost in the fridge overnight before cooking.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cook for 30-35 mins until browned and crisp around the edges. Leave to stand for 10 mins. Scatter with the basil leaves, grind over some black pepper, then cut into squares. Serve with a crisp green salad, if you like."

    "instructions": [
      "To make the ragu, heat the oil in a large shallow pan or flameproof casserole. Squeeze the sausagemeat from its skins in small balls straight into the pan. Sizzle for 10 mins until browned (don\u2019t worry if the meat breaks up). Add the garlic and sizzle for another minute until starting to turn golden, then stir in the chilli flakes, if using, the tomato pur\u00e9e and vinegar. Tip in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and bubble for 30 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour to make a loose paste. Sizzle for a minute, then gradually whisk in the milk. Simmer gently for 10 mins, whisking occasionally to ensure the sauce stays smooth. Season and whisk in the parmesan. Remove from the heat and set aside.",
      "Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of boiling water for 9 mins, or a minute less than pack instructions. Drain and return to the pan. Scrape most of the white sauce into the pasta and stir to coat. Tip in most of the ragu and most of the mozzarella and stir until just combined. Pour the pasta mixture into a large baking dish and spoon over the remaining white sauce and ragu. Dot with the rest of the mozzarella and sprinkle with extra parmesan. Leave to cool completely, then wrap and chill for up to a day, or freeze for up to two months. Defrost in the fridge for 24 hrs before baking.",
      "Heat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Bake for 25-30 mins until the top is slightly crisp at the edges and the cheese is melted. Leave to rest for 5-10 mins, then take the baking dish straight to the table for people to scoop onto their plates."

      "Place the squash in a microwavable bowl with 1 tbsp water. Cook in the microwave on High for 10 mins or until soft. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the sage leaves and sizzle for 1 min. Remove the sausages from their skins and divide into small balls about the size of unshelled hazelnuts. Add to the pan and fry until browned. Add half the squash and set aside. Mash the remaining squash with any liquid from the bowl, the nutmeg and seasoning.",
      "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Cook the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the flour and stir to a paste. Cook for 1-2 mins, stirring the whole time, then gradually mix in the milk until you have a smooth sauce. Add the mashed squash, Parmesan and plenty of seasoning. Add 3-4 tbsp of the sauce to the sausage mix to moisten it a little.",
      "Spread the remaining squash sauce over the base of a large, shallow baking dish. Drain the pasta, but keep a little liquid in the pan to stop the shells from sticking together. Fish any broken bits of pasta out of the pan and scatter these over the sauce. Line up the shells on top, pushing them down into the sauce so only the tops of the shells are poking out. Fill each shell with the sausage mixture. Scatter with fontina or mozzarella, grate over some extra Parmesan and drizzle with a little truffle oil, if you like. Bake for 30 mins or until golden brown."

    "instructions": [
      "Tip the dried porcini mushrooms into a large pan with 600ml boiling water from the kettle. Set over a low heat and simmer for 10-15 mins until slightly reduced to make an intense mushroom stock.",
      "Heat the the oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins into the pan and fry for 5-8 mins, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks, until lightly browned.",
      "Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Drop in the bucatini and move it around using tongs to prevent it sticking together. Cook for 9 mins. Meanwhile, add the garlic and chilli flakes to the sausagemeat and fry for 1 min before pouring in the wine. Cook for 5 mins more until the wine has reduced, then tip in the rehydrated mushrooms and the stock (you should have about 350ml). Season with salt and black pepper, then bring to a simmer.",
      "After roughly 9 mins, use the tongs to move the bucatini directly from its cooking water into the mushroom sauce. The mixture will seem quite watery at first, but the trick is to finish cooking the bucatini by simmering it in the broth \u2013 it will soak it all up and take on the earthy flavour. Keep moving the pasta in the broth using the tongs for 3 mins, or until most of the water has been absorbed. Stir in the cream, a grating of nutmeg and the parsley. Stir well, taste for seasoning and serve topped with lots of parmesan."

    "instructions": [
      "Bring a large, deep pan of salted water to the boil. Plunge the spaghetti into the water, stir well and cook, following pack instructions. Aim for 'al dente': cooked, but retaining some bite in the middle. Take a few strands out of the water with a spaghetti spoon or tongs 1-2 mins before the end of the cooking time and bite into it. Repeat until you think it is properly cooked.",
      "Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a frying pan. When hot, tip in the pancetta. Fry over a medium heat until the fat in the meat has melted down into the pan and the meat has turned lightly golden. Be careful not to crisp the pancetta too much; it will be cooked a little bit more later on in the recipe. Remove from the heat and set aside.",
      "Crack two of the eggs into a mixing bowl. Separate the yolk from the third egg: gently crack the side of the shell and, using both hands, slowly open it into two halves over a separate bowl - you want to keep the yolk in one of the halves. Tip the yolk from one shell half to the other and repeat until all the egg white has fallen into the bowl below, taking care not to crack the yolk on any rough shell edges. Tip the yolk in with the other eggs and beat together, along with the double cream, parmesan and some seasoning.",
      "Add the garlic to the pancetta and return the frying pan to hob. Fry over high heat for 1 min or until garlic is cooked and pancetta warmed through. Meanwhile, drain the spaghetti. Tip back into the hot saucepan off the heat. Pour egg mixture over pasta, followed by hot pancetta, garlic, any fat and oils. Toss quickly and thoroughly with spaghetti spoon or tongs. Mix until it has thickened to a smooth, creamy sauce. Serve with extra cheese and freshly ground pepper."

      "Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.",
      "Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.",
      "Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.",
      "Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).",
      "Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.",
      "While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.",
      "Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.",
      "Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don\u2019t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don\u2019t throw the pasta water away yet.",
      "Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.",
      "Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn\u2019t scramble, and everything is coated.",
      "Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don\u2019t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.",
      "Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived."

Fry the guanciale or pancetta and garlic for 10 mins, or until all the fat has rendered off and the meat is golden and crisp. Remove and discard the garlic clove, then turn off the heat.",

      "Using kitchen tongs, lift the pasta from the water into the pancetta pan along with any dripping water. Use a wooden spoon to stir it into the rendered fat. If the pan looks dry, add a small ladleful of pasta water and mix it in. Keep adding until you see a little pasta water at the bottom of the pan \u2013 you\u2019ll be surprised how much will be absorbed.",
      "Working quickly, tip the beaten yolks in with the pasta and stir vigorously. Rinse the yolk bowl out with a little more pasta water and pour that in too. Add most of the parmesan and beat again. If at any time it\u2019s becoming claggy or starting to scramble, pour in a little more water. If you\u2019ve added too much, stir the pasta over the lowest heat for a few moments. You\u2019re aiming for a smooth sauce that is the consistency of double cream. Season with a couple of pinches of ground black pepper and taste for salt.",
      "Transfer the pasta to the warmed serving dishes, scatter over the remaining parmesan and nestle the last two egg yolks on top, if using. Season them with some salt and pepper, and drizzle over the truffle oil, if you have it, just before serving."

Cover the pan and cook the meatballs on a low heat for about 30 mins, spoon over the sauce occasionally and add a little water if it\u2019s becoming too dry. 15 mins before the end of the cooking time, cook the spaghetti.

      "Using a sharp knife, peel the onion, slice in half through the root and trim off the top. Place the onion, cut-side down, on a chopping board. With your knife parallel to the board, cut 3 slices through the onion, keeping the root intact. With knife point at root end, cut down through the onion, from top to bottom 4 times. Holding the root end, finely slice across the onion (see pic above), to give you small diced pieces.",
      "Set a large frying pan over medium heat and when hot, tip in the oil then onion. Cook for 5 mins until starting to soften, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, cook 2 mins more until the onions start to turn golden. When the onion has softened, tip in the tomatoes and half the basil. Leave to gently bubble for 15 mins until the sauce has thickened and looks pulpy. Stir occasionally and break up any large clumps of tomato with the back of your spoon.",
      "Pour water \u00be of the way up your largest pan. Heat over a high heat and add plenty of salt. When water has reached a rolling boil, place the spaghetti into the pan. As it softens, use your hands to push all of it into the water. Give it a stir to separate the pasta, then cook according to pack instructions, about 10 mins. Taste a strand of pasta. It should be just soft, but not mushy. Scoop out a cup of water before draining in a colander (this will help to loosen your sauce).",
      "Finishing touches: Tip the drained pasta back into its cooking pan, then pour over the tomato sauce. Give everything a good stir. The sauce should just coat the pasta, if it is thick and looks dry, stir in a few spoons of the pasta water. If it is watery, cook over a low heat until evaporated, stirring often. Use your hands to break the mozzarella into chunky pieces and stir through the pasta along with the remaining basil leaves. Serve straight away."

Spend a good 30 mins cooking the mince \u2013 it will release lots of liquid, which you want to evaporate, and then eventually it will end up sizzling in its own fat. If the pan becomes too dry, drizzle in a little more olive oil. Towards the end, continue stirring the mince until it becomes speckled with crisp brown bits.",

While the mince is browning, heat a drizzle more oil in a casserole dish and sizzle the pancetta for 5 mins until it starts to brown and release its fat, then throw in the vegetables and herbs, and finely crumble over the dried porcini. Cook gently for 5 mins until soft and starting to brown. Sprinkle over the sugar, then stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and splash in the fish sauce and vinegar. Simmer down until gloopy, then stir through the meat and pour in the milk and tomatoes. Rinse out the tomato tins with the wine and stir into the pan. Season, then nestle in the parmesan rind.

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to fan 180C/ conventional 200C/gas 6. Season the chicken with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then coat lightly in a little of the flour. Heat the oil in a large ovenproof lidded casserole dish and, in batches, brown the chicken on both sides over a high heat. Remove the chicken and set aside.",
      "Reduce the heat, add the onions and lardons and cook for about 5-8 minutes so they are golden tinged. Add the garlic, then sprinkle in the plain flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring to prevent sticking.",
      "Add the mushrooms, bay leaves, redcurrant sauce and orange zest, then pour in the red wine and stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then return the chicken to the casserole dish, making sure it is well covered with the liquid. Put on the lid and cook in the oven for 30 minutes.",
      "While the casserole is cooking, prepare the dumplings. Put the self raising flour, breadcrumbs, mustard and butter in a food processor and blitz to a crumb consistency. Add the thyme, parsley, eggs and salt and pepper. Briefly blitz until the mixture forms a fairly moist dough. Using floured hands, roll the dough into 6 large, even-sized balls.",
      "Remove the casserole from the oven when the 30 minutes is up and sit the dumplings on top. Pop the lid back on and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes, until the casserole is cooked and the dumplings have puffed up. Spoon the chicken and sauce onto six plates and top each with a dumpling. Serve with a rich, fruity red wine.",
      "If you want to use a slow cooker, brown the chicken in batches and transfer to the slow cooker pot. Add the flour, onions, lardons, garlic, mushrooms, bay leaves, redcurrant, orange zest, red wine and stock, and season. Cover and cook on High for 4 hours. Make the dumplings according to step 4, then sit on top of the casserole after 4 hours. Cook for another 1-2 hours, then serve."

Mix in the grated cheese and add 150ml water, mixing with a cutlery knife to bring the crumbs together to form a light and sticky dough. Break off walnut-sized lumps and shape into small balls. Roll the tops of the dumplings in the pine nuts so a few stick to the outside, then place the dumplings on top of the stew and scatter with any remaining nuts. Put the dish in the oven and bake for 25 mins until the dumplings are golden brown and cooked through. Serve with mashed potato and extra veg if you like."

      "In a wok over a medium heat, fry the ginger with 1 tbsp rapeseed oil for 30 secs. Add the mushrooms and the seasoning mixture and stir-fry for 1 min. Pour the cornflour paste into the wok and stir-fry for 1 min more, or until the sauce thickens.",

      "Flatten the dough balls with your hands. Use the tip of a rolling pin to roll around the edge of the dough ball a few times to flatten it, then gently work around the edges using your fingertips. The aim is to achieve a round sheet of dough with a thicker bump in the middle on which you can place the filling. Repeat until all of the balls have been rolled. Cover them again with the damp tea towel as you go so they don\u2019t dry out.",
      "Taking a dough sheet in the palm of your hand, put 2 tsp of the filling in the middle. Cup your palm so the filling remains in the middle, then gently gather up the edges into the middle and twist to seal. Continue until all the buns are filled. Put them back in the roasting tin and re-cover with the tea towel again",
      "Add 1 tbsp rapeseed oil to a frying pan over a medium heat. Arrange half the buns in the pan, leaving 1/ 2 cm between them so they have enough room to rise during cooking. Fry for 1-2 mins, sprinkling with a little water, then pour 100ml water into the pan and cover with a tight-fitting lid.",
      "Cook for 2-3 mins until all the water has evaporated and the buns have doubled in size. They should become very white and the bottom should be crispy and golden brown. Repeat the process with the remaining 1 tbsp oil and the rest of the buns. Mix the sriracha and oyster sauce together in a small dish and serve with the buns."

    "instructions": [
      "Mix the chicken with the soy sauce, rice wine, ginger, garlic and a pinch of salt in a large bowl. Put in the fridge and leave to marinate for at least 1 hr or ideally overnight. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Tip the rice wine, vinegar and sugar into a saucepan with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then add the garlic and ketchup. Continue to cook for 10 mins until syrupy, then remove from the heat and set aside. To prepare the toppings, put the coriander and spring onion in a bowl of iced water to perk them up. Toast the peppercorns in a dry frying pan, if using, then crush using a pestle and mortar. Mix with 1 tbsp sea salt and set aside.",
      "Mix the beaten egg into the chicken mix, then stir in the cornflour and five-spice powder until the chicken is coated. Set aside. Pour the oil into a wok until it\u2019s no more than a third full and heat to 170C, or heat a deep-fat fryer to the same temperature. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, drop a bit of the batter into the oil; when the batter sizzles and turns golden within 1 min, it\u2019s ready. Fry the chicken in batches for 4-5 mins until golden and crisp, then drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven.",
      "Meanwhile, gently reheat the sauce and add the soy sauce, stock pot or cube, vegetables, pineapple and ginger. Simmer for 3 mins until the veg is slightly softened. Mix the chicken with the sauce and serve with the coriander and spring onions, salt and pepper mix and some rice on the side."

Tip the chicken back in, along with the tomatoes and ketchup, then swill a little water around the cans and pour this in, too. Season and bring to a simmer. Cook for 35 mins until the chicken is pull-apart tender and the sauce is thick. Use two forks to shred the chicken into the sauce. Set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Put everything in a saucepan with some seasoning, then bring to a simmer, whisking continuously. Simmer for 5 mins, still whisking until smooth and thick, then remove from the heat. If not assembling the lasagne straightaway, cover and set aside to cool before chilling. Will keep covered and chilled for two days.",

Scatter with a third of the mozzarella, then add a layer of four or five lasagne sheets (you may need to break one of the sheets to fill the gaps), then repeat the layers twice, finishing with a thick layer of the white sauce. Scatter the parmesan over the top. Will keep chilled for a day or frozen for three months. Leave to cool first. Defrost in the fridge overnight before cooking.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cook for 30-35 mins until browned and crisp around the edges. Leave to stand for 10 mins. Scatter with the basil leaves, grind over some black pepper, then cut into squares. Serve with a crisp green salad, if you like."

      "Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9. Transfer the chicken pieces to a large baking tray (discard any remaining marinade), and cook for 10-15 mins. Turn the pieces after 10 mins so they colour evenly on both sides. The chicken doesn\u2019t need to be completely cooked through at this point as it will cook for a few more mins in the sauce.",
      "Meanwhile, for the sauce, slice the tomatoes in half and put in a large pan in a single layer with 125ml water, the grated ginger, garlic, cardamom, cloves and bay leaf. Simmer, covered, until the tomatoes have completely disintegrated, about 20-25 mins. Remove the whole spices and blend the tomato mixture with a stick blender, then pass it through a sieve to make a smooth pur\u00e9e. Return to a clean pan, add the chilli powder and simmer for 12-15 mins. It should slowly begin to thicken. When the sauce turns glossy, add the chicken pieces and any of the reserved roasting juices from the tray.",
      "Slowly stir in the butter, a couple of pieces at a time, and simmer for 6-8 mins until the chicken is cooked through. Add the chopped ginger, green chillies and cream, then simmer for a min or two longer, taking care that the sauce doesn\u2019t split. Stir in 1 tsp salt, fenugreek leaves, if using, and the garam masala, then check the seasoning, adjust if necessary, then add the sugar. In a separate pan, warm all the ingredients for the spiced butter, if using, until the seeds start to pop (see below). Spoon over the curry, scatter with the coriander, onion, chilli, and a drizzle more cream, if using. Serve with naan, pilau rice and chutney or keto bread for a keto-friendly version."

    "instructions": [
      "Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat.",
      "Season 600g large chunks of shin beef and fry until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches, transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned.",
      "In the same pan, fry 100g sliced smoked streaky bacon, 350g peeled shallots or pearl onions, 250g chestnut mushrooms, 2 sliced garlic cloves and 1 bouquet garni until lightly browned.",
      "Mix in 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and cook for a few mins, stirring the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir through.",
      "Pour over 750ml bottle red wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from the liquid, but isn\u2019t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan \u2013 this will give the stew more flavour.",
      "Heat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche: tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Cook for 3 hrs.",
      "If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few mins until the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the pan.",
      "To make the celeriac mash, peel 600g celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 mins until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper.",
      "Stir in 1 or 2 sprigs of rosemary and thyme, 2 bay leaves and 4 cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer for 25-30 mins.",
      "After 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods.",
      "Lightly crush with a potato masher, then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste.",
      "Spoon the beef bourguignon into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish with one of the bay leaves, if you like."

      "Cut a third off the pastry and set aside. Roll out the pastry to a thickish round that will easily line the pie dish with an overhang, then line the tin.",
      "Add the braising steak to the dish using a slotted spoon so some gravy is left in the container, as you don\u2019t want too much sauce in the pie. You want the filling to be slightly higher than the rim of the dish. If you have a bit too much, set it aside.",
      "Roll out the remaining pastry to a thick round big enough to cover the dish. Brush the edges of the pastry in the dish with 1 beaten egg yolk, then cover with the pastry lid.",
      "Trim the edges, crimp the pastry, then re-roll your trimmings to make a decoration, for example, pastry leaves. Brush the top heavily with egg. Make a few little slits in the centre of the pie, place on the hot baking tray.",
      "Bake for 40 mins until golden. Leave the pie to rest for 10 mins while you heat up the gravy left in the container. Serve the pie at the table with a jug of gravy and a big pile of greens."

      "(Up to a month ahead) heat the oil in a large pan. Fry the bacon lardons over a high heat for several mins until well coloured. Using a slotted spoon, remove from the pan, drain on kitchen paper and set aside. Season the beef, then fry in the fat left in the pan. Once coloured, add all the remaining ingredients for the beef, except the cornfl our and bacon, and bring to a simmer. Partly cover the pan with a lid and continue to cook for a further 2-2\u00bd hrs or until the beef is tender.",
      "Once cooked, tip everything into a colander set over another pan so you can catch the sauce. Tip the contents of the colander into a large pie dish, about 28cm x 23cm x 5cm. Re-boil the sauce and check for seasoning. Thicken with the loosened cornfl our, adding a little at a time and stirring until you have the desired coating consistency. Spoon enough sauce over the beef to barely cover and loosen it, then stir. Remaining sauce can be frozen, ready to re-heat and offer separately on the day.",
      "While the beef is cooling, make the mash. Boil the potatoes until tender, 15-20 mins, depending on size. Drain off the water and replace the lid. Shake the pan to break up the boiled potatoes. Add butter and milk a little at a time while mashing. Season.",
      "Spoon and spread the mashed potatoes on top of the cooled beef. Once covered, the mash can be marked with a spoon, palette knife or fork for a more interesting fi nish (see Gary\u2019s tip, left). When cold, the cottage pie is ready to cover and freeze.",
      "The day before serving, transfer the pie to the fridge to defrost overnight. (Or reheat from frozen on the day, see below.)",
      "On the day, reheat the pie. Heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. If thawed, bake for 50 mins-1 hr, or until heated through, then increase heat to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6 for the fi nal 10 mins for a golden brown topping. If cooking from frozen, cover with foil, then bake for 1\u00bc hrs; remove foil and bake uncovered for 1\u00bc hrs more, then increase heat as above for the last 10 mins."

    "instructions": [
      "Tip 1.6kg braising steak, cut into large chunks, into a large bowl with 3 bay leaves, a small bunch of thyme, 2 bottles of red wine and some pepper, then cover and leave in the fridge overnight.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "Place a colander over another large bowl and strain the marinated meat, keeping the wine.",
      "Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan, then brown the meat in batches, transferring to a plate once browned. When all the meat is browned, pour a little wine into the now-empty frying pan and bubble to release any caramelised bits from the pan.",
      "Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large casserole and fry 3 large or 6 normal carrots, cut into large chunks, and 2 roughly chopped onions until they start to colour. Stir in 3 tbsp plain flour for 1 min, then add 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e.",
      "Add the beef and any juices, the wine from the frying pan and the rest of the wine and herbs. Season and bring to a simmer. Give everything a good stir, then cover.",
      "Transfer to the oven and bake for 2 hrs until the meat is really tender. Cool. Will freeze for up to 3 months.",
      "To serve, defrost completely overnight in the fridge if frozen, then place on a low heat to warm through.",
      "Meanwhile, heat a small knob of butter in a frying pan and add 300g bacon lardons and 500g peeled pearl onions or small shallots. Sizzle for about 10 mins until the bacon starts to crisp and the onions soften and colour.",
      "Add 400g halved mushrooms and fry for another 5 mins, then stir everything into the stew and heat for 10 mins more. Serve scattered with chopped parsley."

Fry the beef in 3-4 batches for about 5 minutes per batch, stirring occasionally, until it is a rich golden brown all over. You may need to add a little more oil between batches but make sure it is hot again before adding the next batch. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside. Don\u2019t worry if the bottom of the casserole is starting to brown, this all adds to the flavour of the finished dish.",

      "Preheat the oven to fan 140C/conventional 160C/gas 3. Tip the carrots, onions and leek into the casserole and fry, stirring occasionally, until they start to brown \u2013 this takes about 12 minutes. Spoon in the tomato pur\u00e9e and continue to cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.",

Season with salt and pepper and bring everything to the boil. Remove from the heat. Cover with a lid and cook in the oven for 2 hours, stirring once halfway through. (The carbonnade may now be left to cool and frozen for up to 1 month. Add 100ml/31\u20442 fl oz more stock to the sauce when reheating.) When the beef is ready, taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if you think it needs it.

This can be done up to 3 days in advance and chilled until ready to make the pie or frozen for up to 3 months.",

Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to fit the pie dish with a slight overhang and drape over the dish. Crimp the edges if you are able to and poke a couple of little steam holes in the middle. Brush the pastry with the beaten egg and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake for 30 mins until golden brown. This is goes well with mash and buttered green beans."

    "description": "Impress dinner guests with these lightly spiced lamb chops served on a bed of broad bean pesto. Serve with fennel fronds, a drizzle of olive oil and lemon",
    "instructions": [
      "Put the chops in a large bowl with the olive oil, lemon juice, chilli and some black pepper. Turn them with your hands, cover and put in the fridge to marinate for a few hours.",
      "Shell the broad beans and cook them in boiling water for 2-3 mins until tender. Drain and rinse in cold water. Slip each bean out of its skin, put them in the bowl of a food processor and add the garlic, mint and anchovy fillets. Remove any fronds from the fennel and set them aside with the tips. Take off any coarse outer layer, split the fennel in half and remove the hard core from each piece. Discard these. Chop the flesh and the reserved fennel trimmings. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan and fry the fennel flesh gently for 10 mins until soft.",
      "Tip the fennel into the food processor along with the cheese and a little seasoning. Blitz to a pur\u00e9e while pouring in 120ml of the olive oil. Taste and add the lemon juice. You might find you want a bit more olive oil as well, or a little water to produce a thinner consistency. Remember to season again if you add water. Scrape the pur\u00e9e into a bowl and keep covered in the fridge until you\u2019re ready to serve, but let it come to room temperature before you cook the chops.",
      "Take the chops out of the fridge and bring to room temperature. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Lift the chops out of the marinade and, when the pan is really hot, cook until well coloured on each side, seasoning as you go. Press the meaty bit down so that they get good griddle marks. The chops should be pink in the middle when you serve them \u2013 they only take 1\u00bd mins on each side as they\u2019re so small. Do this in batches if you need to.",
      "Serve the chops on top of the pur\u00e9e with some mint scattered over, any reserved fennel fonds, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and some lemon wedges on the side."

      "Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry 1\u00bckg beef mince until browned \u2013 you may need to do this in batches. Set aside as it browns.",
      "Put the other 2 tbsp olive oil into the pan, add 2 finely chopped onions, 3 chopped carrots and 3 chopped celery sticks and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 mins.",
      "Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, 3 tbsp plain flour and 1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e, increase the heat and cook for a few mins, then return the beef to the pan.",
      "Pour over a large glass of red wine, if using, and boil to reduce it slightly before adding the 850ml beef stock, 4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, a few thyme sprigs and 2 bay leaves.",
      "Bring to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 mins. By this time the gravy should be thick and coating the meat. Check after about 30 mins \u2013 if a lot of liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce the gravy a little. Season well, then discard the bay leaves and thyme stalks.",
      "Meanwhile, make the mash. In a large saucepan, cover the 1.8kg potatoes which you've peeled and chopped, in salted cold water, bring to the boil and simmer until tender.",
      "Drain well, then allow to steam-dry for a few mins. Mash well with the 225ml milk, 25g butter, and three-quarters of the 200g strong cheddar cheese, then season with freshly grated nutmeg and some salt and pepper.",
      "Spoon the meat into 2 ovenproof dishes. Pipe or spoon on the mash to cover. Sprinkle on the remaining cheese.",
      "If eating straight away, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 mins, or until the topping is golden.",
      "If you want to use a slow cooker, brown your mince in batches then tip into your slow cooker and stir in the vegetables, flour, pur\u00e9e, wine, stock, Worcestershire sauce and herbs with some seasoning. Cover and cook on High for 4-5 hours. Make the mash following the previous steps, and then oven cook in the same way to finish."

If the crumbs are not sticking well make the cornflour mixture a little bit thicker and try again. Press firmly.",

      "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cut the top off the pumpkin or squash and use a metal spoon to scoop out the seeds. Get rid of any pithy bits but keep the seeds for another time (see our pumpkin seed recipe ideas). Put the pumpkin on a baking tray, rub with 2 tbsp of the oil inside and out, and season well. Roast in the centre of the oven for 45 mins or until tender, with the \u2018lid\u2019 on the side.",
      "Meanwhile, rinse the wild rice well and cook following pack instructions, then spread out on a baking tray to cool. Thinly slice the fennel bulb and apple, then squeeze over \u00bd the lemon juice to stop them discolouring.",
      "Heat the remaining 2 tbsp oil in a frying pan. Fry the fennel seeds and chilli flakes, then, once the seeds begin to pop, stir in \u00bd the garlic and the fennel. Cook for 5 mins until softened, then mix through the apple, pecans and lemon zest. Remove from the heat. Add the mixture to the the cooked rice, then stir in the chopped parsley and taste for seasoning.",
      "Pack the mixture into the cooked pumpkin and return to the oven for 10-15 mins until everything is piping hot. Meanwhile, whisk the remaining lemon juice with the tahini, the rest of the garlic and enough water to make a dressing. Serve the pumpkin in the middle of the table, topped with pomegranate seeds and the dressing."

    "description": "Make this fantastic vegan beetroot, sweet potato, chard and celeriac rainbow-layered pie as a stunning centrepiece for a meat-free Christmas or dinner party",
    "instructions": [
      "First, make the filling. Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Mix together 1\u00bd tbsp oil with the cumin, cinnamon and vinegar, and rub the mixture all over the beetroot. Put the beetroot into a small roasting tin, season well, then cover with foil and roast for 20 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, toss the celeriac with 2\u00bd tbsp oil, the thyme, garlic and some seasoning in a second roasting tin. Separate out the slices so they cook evenly, then cover the tin in foil. In a third roasting tin, mix the sweet potato with the remaining oil, the smoked paprika and some seasoning, and cover with foil. Once the beets have cooked for 20 mins, add the celeriac and sweet potato to the oven alongside them, and roast all the veg for 40 mins further or until tender. Remove the thyme sprigs, squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and mash them in with the celeriac, then leave all the veg to cool. All the veg can be cooked the day before and kept in the fridge.",
      "For the pastry, boil the kettle and use some coconut oil to grease a deep 20cm springform cake tin. Pour the flour into a bowl and add 1 tsp salt. Mix the coconut oil with 200ml boiling water, stir until melted (put it in the microwave if need be), then pour into the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to form a dough. Working as quickly as you can (it\u2019s best to roll the pastry when it\u2019s warm), cut off a \u00bc of the dough and set aside under a tea towel. Roll out the rest to 0.5cm thick, then use it to line the cake tin, pressing the dough into the corners and leaving any excess pastry overhanging the sides. Don\u2019t worry if the pastry breaks \u2013 it\u2019s very forgiving, so you can patch it up as you go. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
      "Now build the pie. Cover the base with chard leaves, then scatter over the semolina (which will absorb the beet juices), press in the beetroot, and season. Add another layer of chard, followed by the sweet potato, and season. Add a final layer of chard leaves, then top with the celeriac and season again.",
      "Roll out the pastry you set aside to a thickness of 0.5cm to use as the lid. Put the lid on top of the pie and, using a fork, press together the overhanging pastry to create a crimped edge. Make a steam hole, then brush the top with a little almond milk mixed with a spoonful of oil (this will help to colour the pastry). Bake in the centre of the oven for 45 mins until the pastry is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool for 15 mins, then remove from the tin and serve in the middle of the table. Will keep for up to three days in the fridge (the pie is also delicious cold)."

Cut each sheet into three widthways so that you have six strips in total then divide the kale pesto between these, followed by the roasted veg and lentils, heaping the mixture on top of the pesto and leaving one side free of filling so that it is easier to roll. Brush all the borders with half the milk, fold over the ends, then carefully roll the pastry lengthways to completely encase the filling into a roll.

Trim off the feathery bits of jackfruit that look a bit like shredded meat, weigh out 75g and stir in the tamari sauce. Tip the remaining jackfruit into a bowl. Add the chickpeas, tomato pur\u00e9e and garlic and blitz together until smooth using a hand blender or use a food processor. Stir in the remaining jackfruit and shape into four burgers about the size of the mushrooms. Coat in the flour.",

Serve with half the chips, sprinkled with the paprika, and serve half the relish on the side. The remaining mushrooms, burgers and chips will keep for two days in the fridge. To serve again, warm the remaining mushrooms and burgers in a low oven, and heat the chips, uncovered, until piping hot."

Add the mushrooms, leeks , onions, carrots and the stock cube and cook gently for 5 mins , stirring every so often. If it starts to stick, reduce the heat and stir more frequently, scraping the bits from the bottom. The veg should be soft but not mushy.",
      "Add the garlic, tomato pur\u00e9e, paprika, squash and herbs. Stir and turn the heat up a bit, cook for 3 mins, add the celery, then stir and cook for a few more mins.",
      "Tip in the chickpeas along with the water in the can and reserved mushroom stock. Add the peas and spinach and stir well. Cook for 5 mins, stirring occasionally, then season, turn off and set aside. There should still be plenty of liquid and the veg should be bright and a little firm.",
      "Peel the potatoes and discard the skin. Mash 200g with a fork and stir into the veg. Break the rest of the potatoes into chunks, mix with the olive oil and parsley and season.",
      "Divide the filling into the pie dishes and top with the potatotes. Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and bake the pies for 40-45 mins, until the top is golden and the filling is heated through. If making individual pies, check after 20 mins. Best served with tomato ketchup \u2013 as all great shepherd\u2019s pies are."

      "While the cakes are cooling, make the filling. To make the vegan buttercream, whisk or beat together the dairy-free spread, icing sugar and remaining vanilla seeds until pale and fluffy. Dairy-free spreads do vary, so if the spread you are using is quite soft, try to avoid using electric beaters. Stir the ingredients together instead to avoid overworking it. However, if the mixture is too firm, use electric beaters to help lighten it and add 1-2 tbsp dairy-free milk when whisking.",
      "Spread the jam onto one of the cooled sponges, top with the buttercream, then place the other sponge on top. Dust the assembled cake with a little icing sugar or caster sugar before slicing."

Measure 150ml of cold water and 150ml boiling water into a jug and mix them together \u2013 this will mean your water is a good temperature for the yeast. Add the oil and 1 tsp salt to the warm water then pour it over the flour. Stir well with a spoon then start to knead the mixture together in the bowl until it forms a soft and slightly sticky dough. If it\u2019s too dry add a splash of cold water.",

      "Heat oven to 220C/200C/gas 9 and put a baking sheet or pizza stone on the top shelf to heat up. Once the dough has risen, knock it back by punching it a couple of times with your fist then kneading it again on a floured surface. It should be springy and a lot less sticky. Set aside while you prepare the sauce.",
      "Put all the ingredients for the tomato sauce together in a bowl, season with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar if you like and mix well. Set aside until needed.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 or 4 pieces (depending on whether you want to make large or small pizzas), shape into balls and flatten each piece out as thin as you can get it with a rolling pin or using your hands. Make sure the dough is well dusted with flour to stop it sticking. Dust another baking sheet with flour then put a pizza base on top \u2013 spread 4-5 tbsp of the tomato sauce on top and add some sliced tomatoes and grated vegan cheese. Drizzle with a little olive oil and bake in the oven on top of your preheated baking tray for 10-12 mins or until the base is puffed up and the vegan cheese has melted and is bubbling and golden in patches.",
      "Repeat with the rest of the dough and topping. Serve the pizzas with fresh basil leaves or chilli oil if you like and sprinkle over vegan parmesan just after baking."

    "instructions": [
      "First, make the pastry. Tip the flour and butter into a bowl, then rub together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Mix in the egg, then bring everything together using your hands until just combined. Form into a disc. Will keep wrapped and chilled for up to two days or frozen for up to a month.",
      "Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface into a disc that\u2019s roughly 28cm in diameter. Use the rolling pin to lift it over a 23cm tart tin, then drape it over the tin. Use a small ball of pastry scraps to push the pastry into the base and up the side of the tin, leaving the excess to overhang. Chill in the fridge for 20 mins. The tin can be lined and chilled up to a day ahead.",
      "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan over a low-medium heat and cook the onions for 45 mins, seasoning them generously with salt and stirring occasionally until they become sticky and golden. Pour in the cream, then add the nutmeg and stir. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat.",
      "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Lightly prick the base of the tart all over with a fork, then line with a large circle of baking parchment and fill with baking beans, dried rice or pulses. Bake for 20 mins, then remove the beans and parchment, and bake for 10-15 mins more until light brown. Break off a little of the the overhanging pastry to check that it\u2019s done \u2013 it should be cooked through and crumbly.",
      "Meanwhile, stir the egg yolks into the onion and cream mixture, and stir in two-thirds of the cheese. Tip into the pastry case, then sprinkle over the rest of the cheese and bake for 20-25 mins, or until just set and golden. Leave to cool completely in the tin, trim the overhang using a serrated knife, then remove from the tin. Sprinkle with chives and more cheese, if you like. Any leftovers will keep chilled for up to two days. Reheat in a low oven before serving."

Spoon the cooled veg mixture into the centre piling it up high. Roll out the larger pastry block as before, ensuring the square is enough to cover the base. Brush the exposed pastry on the base around the mushroom filling with soya milk, then lay the larger pastry square on top to enclose the filling. Press around the edges to seal, then trim the edges so you end up with an 18cm circle with the filling in the middle. Score lines or patterns into the top of the pastry, being careful not to cut all the way through. Brush all over with soya milk, then bake for 30-40 mins until the filling is hot and the pastry is puffed up and golden."

    "instructions": [
      "Fill a medium saucepan with hot water from the tap until it\u2019s three-quarters full. Set the pan on the hob. Season the water with a pinch of salt, then turn the heat to medium-high \u2013 the water should start to boil after a minute or so. Slowly tip the pasta into the boiling water \u2013 do this carefully, as any splashes could burn your skin.",
      "Holding the handle of the saucepan with one hand (use a cloth if it\u2019s hot), carefully stir the pasta with a long wooden spoon in the other hand \u2013 this will prevent the pasta from sticking together. Set a timer for 10 mins. Stir the pasta every minute or so, and keep checking the heat to make sure the water is gently boiling while the timer counts down.",
      "While the pasta cooks, measure 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 tsp dried oregano into a mixing bowl. Season with some salt and black pepper, and mix well \u2013 this will make a zingy dressing for the pasta.",
      "When the timer beeps, it\u2019s time to check if the pasta is cooked. To do this, scoop one piece of pasta out of the boiling water using the wooden spoon, tip it onto a plate and leave it to cool slightly. Taste the pasta: if it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s cooked through, but if it\u2019s still a little hard in the middle, it needs to cook for a bit longer. Set the timer for another 2 mins, then check again.",
      "Place a large colander or sieve in the sink. When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and, using two hands, carefully carry the saucepan over to the sink and tip the pasta into the colander to drain away the hot water. Leave to cool for a few minutes in the colander, then tip the pasta into the mixing bowl with the dressing. Mix together until the pasta is coated in the dressing.",
      "Put a chopping board on a work surface. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half by pinching each one between your thumb and index finger, and carefully slicing through the middle of the tomato with a small serrated knife. Slice the pitted olives in the same way, then tip all the tomatoes and olives into the pasta.",
      "Put the cucumber on the chopping board and cut it in half lengthways. Lay the two halves on the board cut-side down, so they don\u2019t roll around. Cut each piece in half again, so you have four long, chunky pieces. Cut across the cucumber pieces in the other direction so you end up with small cucumber triangles. Tip these into the bowl with the pasta, tomatoes and olives.",
      "Put the onion on the board and hold it securely. Cut off the pointy end, then cut the onion in half through the root end. Peel away the papery outer layers until you\u2019re left with just the shiny onion underneath. Lay each onion half on the board, cut-side down so it doesn\u2019t roll around. Holding onto the root end, carefully slice the halves into half-moon shapes, as thinly as you can. Stop when you get to the root. Tip the onions into the bowl.",

It will take about 5 hrs if using a multi-function cooker with a locked lid that requires you to keep opening and stirring it.",
      "Oil a 20cm baking tin and line with baking parchment. Remove the bowl of the slow cooker carefully and set on a heatproof mat or chopping board. Mix with a wooden spoon or spatula vigorously for 10-15 mins to cool the fudge and to break up any large sugar crystals. The fudge will thicken as it cools and start to look matte. Tip into the tin and use a spatula to smooth the surface. Sprinkle with a little more salt and chill until set, about 1 hr. Cut into chunks. Will keep for five days in an airtight container."
