            "Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).",

            "Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
            "Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.",
            "Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.",
            "Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.",
            "Add a 400g can of chopped tomatoes. Tip in \u00bd tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and add a good shake of salt and pepper. Squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e and stir the sauce well.",

            "Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce doesn\u2019t catch on the bottom of the pan or isn\u2019t drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat really is low enough. After simmering gently, the saucy mince mixture should look thick, moist and juicy.",
            "Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.",
            "Taste a bit of the chilli and season. It will probably take a lot more seasoning than you think.",
            "Now replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave your chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving. This is really important as it allows the flavours to mingle.",
            "Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice."

Cover with water and a lid, and simmer for 3 hrs or until really tender \u2013 you may need to top up the water level during cooking. (Alternatively, cook in a slow cooker for 6-8 hrs.) Leave to cool in the liquid, then chill overnight if you have time.",
            "To make the pastry, tip the flour into a big bowl with 1/2 tsp salt and the mustard powder. Hold the butter block in the foil (peeling back a little at a time as you need to) and coarsely grate straight into the bowl of flour, dipping the end of the butter into the flour every so often \u2013 this helps to stop all the butter clumping together. Grate in the cheese too. Use a cutlery knife to lightly stir together, then stir in 175-200ml cold water to bring the dough together. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 mins.",
            "Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a pan of boiling water for 8 mins or until just cooked, then drain. Melt the butter in another large pan and add the shallots. Cook gently for 10-15 mins until tender and golden, shaking the pan now and then to roll them around in the butter. While they cook, drain the ham hocks, reserving the cooking liquid \u2013 the meat should be nice and tender. Shred with two forks, discarding the fat and bones.",
            "When the shallots are tender, scoop them out of the pan and add to the ham. Add the flour and mustard powder to the butter, stirring around the pan to make a paste. Cook for 1-2 mins, then splash in a little of the milk, stirring until smooth. Continue adding the milk, bit by bit, stirring well after each addition, until you have a very thick, smooth sauce. Add enough of the ham\u2019s cooking liquid to thin the sauce to a double cream consistency, about 300ml. Taste and season with pepper \u2013 it should be salty enough from the ham stock, but add a little extra if it needs it. Stir in the ham, potatoes, shallots, wholegrain mustard, honey and parsley, then leave to cool.",
            "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf to heat up. Remove the pastry from the fridge. Divide into 2 balls, one a little larger than the other \u2013 keep the smaller one wrapped until later. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the large ball of dough to the thickness of a \u00a31 coin. Use this to line the base of a 23cm metal pie plate or shallow cake tin. Fill with the pie filling, then brush the edges with a little beaten egg. Roll out the remaining pastry, lay over the top, then trim the excess. Crimp the sides of the pie, if you like. Brush with more egg wash and poke 2 steam holes in the top with a sharp knife. Place the pie on the hot baking sheet and bake for 45-50 mins until crisp and golden. Serve piping hot with green veg and gravy, if you like."

Add 1 tbsp cold water, if needed, until it forms a short pastry. Knead quickly into a ball, then wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 30 mins. Can be made three days ahead or frozen for two months.",
            "Season the steak generously and toss with the flour and mustard powder. Heat half the oil in a large pan. Brown the meat in a few batches, adding more oil as you need to and making sure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan. Turn the meat only when the underside has a nice dark crust. Transfer the chunks to a plate as you go.",
            "Add the bacon to the pan and fry until beginning to crisp. Tip in the carrots, onions and bay leaves and cook for another few mins until the veg is soft. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce and tomato pur\u00e9e for 1 min, scraping the tasty bits from the bottom of the pan, then add the stock, thyme and browned beef. Season, cover the pan and simmer gently for 2\u00bd hrs, stirring now and again to prevent the sauce from sticking, until the beef is tender. Remove the lid for the last 30 mins to thicken the sauce. Alternatively, braise in the oven at 160C/140C fan/gas 3 for the same amount of time. Leave to cool. Can be chilled for up to three days, or frozen for two months.",
            "Transfer the beef to a pie dish and crumble the cheese over the top. Place the marrowbone in the centre, nestling it into the meat. Alternatively, use a pie funnel or piping nozzle. Roll out the pastry on a floured worktop until large enough to cover the pie and about \u00bdcm thick. Brush the remaining beaten egg over the edges of the pie dish, drape the pastry over, trim the excess and pinch around the edge to seal. Cut a hole for the marrowbone or pie funnel to poke through, and brush the top all over with beaten egg. Use the pastry trimmings to decorate the pie however you like. Chill for about 30 mins while you heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
            "If you have any beaten egg left, give the pie a final brush for extra glossiness. Bake for 45-50 mins until the pastry is deep golden."

Pour in the stock and stir in the flour paste, stirring all the time until the gravy has thickened. Cover and cook for 5 mins over a low heat, then strain into a bowl or small freezer container, pushing through as much liquid left in the shallots as you can.",
            "Wash the pan, then melt the butter and cook the shallot and garlic until softened. Add the mushrooms and thyme, and fry for 10 mins, stirring frequently, to drive off as much moisture as possible. Season with black pepper and sparingly with salt. Cool.",

Spread the mushroom mixture on top, then scatter evenly with the cheese and walnuts. Place the steak on top, then tightly wrap the prosciutto round it, using the cling film to help you. Finally, tightly wrap in the cling film and chill for 30 mins.",
            "Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until you think it is large enough to completely wrap round the steak roll. Unwrap the meat, place on top of the pastry and brush round it with the egg mixture. Tightly roll up in the pastry, trimming the excess as you bring the pastry together down the length and ends, sealing well. If you want to add decoration, cut out leaf shapes from the trimmings and use the egg mixture to stick them to the pastry. Chill until ready to cook. Will keep for 2 days. (If freezing, wrap in new cling film, then foil, and freeze along with the gravy and egg glaze. The day before, take everything out of the freezer and put in the fridge, unwrapping the steak roll and covering it loosely with kitchen paper.)",

Cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 15-20 mins. Trim off the pastry end, then thickly slice and serve with the gravy, heated in a pan, and seasonal vegetables."

Crimp the edges using a fork to seal, then use the tip of a knife to lightly cut three lines across the top of the pies so that steam can escape during cooking.",

At this stage, the pies can be chilled for up to 24 hrs or individually covered and kept frozen for two months.",

Brush with more of the beaten egg, sprinkle with the demerara sugar and bake for 15-20 mins, or until the pastry is golden (add another 10 mins if baking from frozen). Once baked and cooled, will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days."

Pour the cream, condensed milk and vanilla into a second bowl and beat for 3 mins using an electric whisk until slightly thickened and the beaters leave a trail in the mixture when lifted across the bowl. Be careful not to overwhip, as you don\u2019t want the mixture to be too stiff \u2013 as soon as the beaters leave a trail, it\u2019s ready.",

Fold in most of the chocolate chips, reserving a small handful. Scrape the mixture into a 1-litre freezerproof container, then scatter over the reserved chocolate chips. Cover and freeze for at least 6 hrs until firm but scoopable. Will keep frozen for up to a month. To serve, scoop the ice cream into chilled bowls or ice cream cones and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt, if you like."

Line the tart case with foil or baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15 mins. Carefully remove the baking beans and foil, then return to the oven for 5-10 mins until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin on a wire rack while you finish the filling.",

Sprinkle over the pine nuts and bake for 35-40 mins \u2013 the filling will still be quite wobbly but it will firm up as it cools. Chill for at least 3 hrs, or overnight.

            "Use a layer of the green part of the leek to wrap around and make a herb bundle with the thyme, bay, parsley stalks, orange peel and chilli. Tie everything together with kitchen string and set aside.",
            "Heat the oil in a very large casserole dish or stock pot and throw in the onion, sliced leek and fennel and cook for about 10 mins until softened. Stir through the garlic and cook for 2 mins more, then add the herb bundle, tomato pur\u00e9e, star anise, Pernod if using, chopped tomatoes and saffron. Simmer and stir for a minute or two then pour over the fish stock. Season with salt and pepper, bring to a simmer, then add the piece of potato. Bubble everything gently for 30 mins until you have a thin tomatoey soup. When that piece of potato is on the brink of collapse, fish it out and set aside to make the rouille.",
            "While the broth is simmering make the rouille by crushing the garlic, chilli and saffron with a pinch of salt in a mortar with a pestle. Mash in the cooked potato to make a sticky paste then whisk in the egg yolk and, very gradually, the olive oil until you make a mayonnaise-like sauce. Stir in the lemon juice and set aside.",
            "Once the chunky tomato broth has cooked you have two options: for a rustic bouillabaisse, simply poach your fish in it along with the mussels, if you're using (just until they open) and serve. For a refined version, remove the herb bundle and star anise. Using a handheld or table-top blender, blitz the soup until smooth. Pass the soup through a sieve into a large, clean pan and bring to a gentle simmer. Starting with the densest fish, add the chunks to the broth and cook for 1 min before adding the next type. With the fish we used, the order was: monkfish, John Dory, grey mullet, snapper. When all the fish is in, scatter over the mussels, if using, and simmer everything for about 5 mins until just cooked and the mussels have opened.",
            "Use a slotted spoon to carefully scoop the fish and mussels out onto a warmed serving platter, moisten with just a little broth and scatter over the chopped parsley. Bring everything to the table. Some people eat it as two courses, serving the broth with croutons and rouille first, then the fish spooned into the same bowl. Others simply serve it as a fish stew. Whichever way you choose the rouille is there to be stirred into the broth to thicken and give it a kick."

            "Holding the handle of the saucepan with one hand (use a cloth if it\u2019s hot), carefully stir the pasta with a long wooden spoon in the other hand \u2013 this will prevent the pasta from sticking together. Set a timer for 10 mins. Stir the pasta every minute or so, and keep checking the heat to make sure the water is gently boiling while the timer counts down.",
            "While the pasta cooks, measure 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar and 1 tsp dried oregano into a mixing bowl. Season with some salt and black pepper, and mix well \u2013 this will make a zingy dressing for the pasta.",

To do this, scoop one piece of pasta out of the boiling water using the wooden spoon, tip it onto a plate and leave it to cool slightly. Taste the pasta: if it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s cooked through, but if it\u2019s still a little hard in the middle, it needs to cook for a bit longer. Set the timer for another 2 mins, then check again.",

When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and, using two hands, carefully carry the saucepan over to the sink and tip the pasta into the colander to drain away the hot water. Leave to cool for a few minutes in the colander, then tip the pasta into the mixing bowl with the dressing. Mix together until the pasta is coated in the dressing.",

Cut the cherry tomatoes in half by pinching each one between your thumb and index finger, and carefully slicing through the middle of the tomato with a small serrated knife. Slice the pitted olives in the same way, then tip all the tomatoes and olives into the pasta.",
            "Put the cucumber on the chopping board and cut it in half lengthways. Lay the two halves on the board cut-side down, so they don\u2019t roll around. Cut each piece in half again, so you have four long, chunky pieces. Cut across the cucumber pieces in the other direction so you end up with small cucumber triangles. Tip these into the bowl with the pasta, tomatoes and olives.",
            "Put the onion on the board and hold it securely. Cut off the pointy end, then cut the onion in half through the root end. Peel away the papery outer layers until you\u2019re left with just the shiny onion underneath. Lay each onion half on the board, cut-side down so it doesn\u2019t roll around. Holding onto the root end, carefully slice the halves into half-moon shapes, as thinly as you can. Stop when you get to the root. Tip the onions into the bowl.",

Stir through the pur\u00e9e, bay leaves and tomatoes, with a canful of water. Simmer for 1\u00bd hrs, covered for the first hour, then remove the lid and bubble until the tomatoes have broken down. Season with salt, pepper, the sugar and balsamic vinegar.",

Bake for 20-30 mins until the top is golden and bubbling, and the pasta is tender. Grate over some parmesan and finish with a few basil leaves."

Once all the milk has been added, drizzle in the evaporated milk, then add the grated cheddar, a handful at a time, until you have a thick, cheesy sauce. Stir through the mustard powder, cayenne, yeast extract and vinegar and taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed.",

            "Heat oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 2. While the mince is browning, heat a drizzle more oil in a casserole dish and sizzle the pancetta for 5 mins until it starts to brown and release its fat, then throw in the vegetables and herbs, and finely crumble over the dried porcini. Cook gently for 5 mins until soft and starting to brown. Sprinkle over the sugar, then stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and splash in the fish sauce and vinegar. Simmer down until gloopy, then stir through the meat and pour in the milk and tomatoes. Rinse out the tomato tins with the wine and stir into the pan. Season, then nestle in the parmesan rind. Bring to a simmer, then cover and cook in the oven for 3 hrs.",

Cook the pasta until very al dente, then tong into the pan with a bit of the water and finish cooking with the sauce for 2 mins. Stir through the parmesan and a drizzle more olive oil. Twirl the pasta and Bolognese into bowls, scatter with basil and serve with more parmesan."

Continue to cook for 10 mins until syrupy, then remove from the heat and set aside. To prepare the toppings, put the coriander and spring onion in a bowl of iced water to perk them up. Toast the peppercorns in a dry frying pan, if using, then crush using a pestle and mortar. Mix with 1 tbsp sea salt and set aside.",

Pour the oil into a wok until it\u2019s no more than a third full and heat to 170C, or heat a deep-fat fryer to the same temperature. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, drop a bit of the batter into the oil; when the batter sizzles and turns golden within 1 min, it\u2019s ready. Fry the chicken in batches for 4-5 mins until golden and crisp, then drain on kitchen paper and keep warm in a low oven.",

Mix the chicken with the sauce and serve with the coriander and spring onions, salt and pepper mix and some rice on the side."

Tip the chicken back in, along with the tomatoes and ketchup, then swill a little water around the cans and pour this in, too. Season and bring to a simmer.

Remove the whole spices and blend the tomato mixture with a stick blender, then pass it through a sieve to make a smooth pur\u00e9e. Return to a clean pan, add the chilli powder and simmer for 12-15 mins. It should slowly begin to thicken.

Add the chopped ginger, green chillies and cream, then simmer for a min or two longer, taking care that the sauce doesn\u2019t split. Stir in 1 tsp salt, fenugreek leaves, if using, and the garam masala, then check the seasoning, adjust if necessary, then add the sugar. In a separate pan, warm all the ingredients for the spiced butter, if using, until the seeds start to pop (see below). Spoon over the curry, scatter with the coriander, onion, chilli, and a drizzle more cream, if using. Serve with naan, pilau rice and chutney or keto bread for a keto-friendly version."

Make a small heart from cuttings. Brush top of the pie and heart with beaten egg, then dip heart into poppy seeds and stick to top. Bake for 30-40 mins until golden brown and crisp. Reheat sauce and serve with the pie along with some mash and greens."

Fry the beef in 3-4 batches for about 5 minutes per batch, stirring occasionally, until it is a rich golden brown all over. You may need to add a little more oil between batches but make sure it is hot again before adding the next batch. Remove the meat with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside. Don\u2019t worry if the bottom of the casserole is starting to brown, this all adds to the flavour of the finished dish.",

Tip the carrots, onions and leek into the casserole and fry, stirring occasionally, until they start to brown \u2013 this takes about 12 minutes. Spoon in the tomato pur\u00e9e and continue to cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.",

(The carbonnade may now be left to cool and frozen for up to 1 month. Add 100ml/31\u20442 fl oz more stock to the sauce when reheating.) When the beef is ready, taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if you think it needs it. Scatter the chopped parsley over the top and serve straight from the casserole, with creamy mash or jacket potatoes and buttered greens or cabbage."

The chops should be pink in the middle when you serve them \u2013 they only take 1\u00bd mins on each side as they\u2019re so small. Do this in batches if you need to.",

Roll out the rest to 0.5cm thick, then use it to line the cake tin, pressing the dough into the corners and leaving any excess pastry overhanging the sides. Don\u2019t worry if the pastry breaks \u2013 it\u2019s very forgiving, so you can patch it up as you go. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",
            "Now build the pie. Cover the base with chard leaves, then scatter over the semolina (which will absorb the beet juices), press in the beetroot, and season. Add another layer of chard, followed by the sweet potato, and season. Add a final layer of chard leaves, then top with the celeriac and season again.",
            "Roll out the pastry you set aside to a thickness of 0.5cm to use as the lid. Put the lid on top of the pie and, using a fork, press together the overhanging pastry to create a crimped edge. Make a steam hole, then brush the top with a little almond milk mixed with a spoonful of oil (this will help to colour the pastry). Bake in the centre of the oven for 45 mins until the pastry is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool for 15 mins, then remove from the tin and serve in the middle of the table. Will keep for up to three days in the fridge (the pie is also delicious cold)."

Roast for 30-35 mins until the veg is caramelised. Remove from the oven, fish out the roasted garlic cloves, then mash them on a chopping board with a fork and set aside. Tip the rest of the roasted veg mixture into a baking dish.",

Gradually pour in the milk, stirring well after each addition. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 5 mins, stirring often until thickened. Remove from the heat, add the mashed roasted garlic and the cheddar, and stir until the cheese has melted. Season well. Roughly chop the cauliflower leaves and stir these through the sauce.",

Sprinkle over the sourdough crumbs, then return to the oven for 15-20 mins, or until the top is golden and the sauce is bubbling at the edges. Serve alongside roast chicken, or as a main with a green salad on the side. To freeze, leave to cool completely in the dish, wrap well and freeze for up to three months. Defrost completely in the fridge overnight, then bake as directed."

The tin can be lined and chilled up to a day ahead.",

Lightly prick the base of the tart all over with a fork, then line with a large circle of baking parchment and fill with baking beans, dried rice or pulses. Bake for 20 mins, then remove the beans and parchment, and bake for 10-15 mins more until light brown. Break off a little of the the overhanging pastry to check that it\u2019s done \u2013 it should be cooked through and crumbly.",

Leave to cool completely in the tin, trim the overhang using a serrated knife, then remove from the tin. Sprinkle with chives and more cheese, if you like. Any leftovers will keep chilled for up to two days. Reheat in a low oven before serving."

            "Holding the handle of the saucepan with one hand (use a cloth if it\u2019s hot), carefully stir the pasta with a long wooden spoon in the other hand \u2013 this will prevent the pasta from sticking together. Set a timer for 10 mins. Stir the pasta every minute or so, and keep checking the heat to make sure the water is gently boiling while the timer counts down.",

To do this, scoop one piece of pasta out of the boiling water using the wooden spoon, tip it onto a plate and leave it to cool slightly. Taste the pasta: if it\u2019s soft, it\u2019s cooked through, but if it\u2019s still a little hard in the middle, it needs to cook for a bit longer. Set the timer for another 2 mins, then check again.",

When the pasta is cooked, turn off the heat and, using two hands, carefully carry the saucepan over to the sink and tip the pasta into the colander to drain away the hot water. Leave to cool for a few minutes in the colander, then tip the pasta into the mixing bowl with the dressing. Mix together until the pasta is coated in the dressing.",

Cut the cherry tomatoes in half by pinching each one between your thumb and index finger, and carefully slicing through the middle of the tomato with a small serrated knife. Slice the pitted olives in the same way, then tip all the tomatoes and olives into the pasta.",

Cut each piece in half again, so you have four long, chunky pieces. Cut across the cucumber pieces in the other direction so you end up with small cucumber triangles. Tip these into the bowl with the pasta, tomatoes and olives.",

Peel away the papery outer layers until you\u2019re left with just the shiny onion underneath. Lay each onion half on the board, cut-side down so it doesn\u2019t roll around.

Simmer for 5 mins until the sauce is slightly reduced and the apricots plump, then stir in the veg and some seasoning. Serve with couscous or jacket potatoes."

            "Put the caster sugar, golden syrup, clotted cream, vanilla and a pinch of sea salt flakes in a slow cooker. Stir until well-mixed and smooth. Cook on high for 4-5 hrs, stirring every 30 mins, or until it\u2019s a golden caramel colour and looks glossy. If your slow cooker works with the lid off, cook uncovered to speed up cooking. It will take about 5 hrs if using a multi-function cooker with a locked lid that requires you to keep opening and stirring it.",
            "Oil a 20cm baking tin and line with baking parchment. Remove the bowl of the slow cooker carefully and set on a heatproof mat or chopping board. Mix with a wooden spoon or spatula vigorously for 10-15 mins to cool the fudge and to break up any large sugar crystals. The fudge will thicken as it cools and start to look matte. Tip into the tin and use a spatula to smooth the surface. Sprinkle with a little more salt and chill until set, about 1 hr. Cut into chunks. Will keep for five days in an airtight container."
